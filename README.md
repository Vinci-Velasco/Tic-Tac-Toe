# Tic-Tac-Toe
C++ implementation of tic tac toe on the command line.

Goal: To recreate a simple game of tic-tac-toe for practice as 1st year
      computer science student.

Possible ways to expand the project:

    1. Display # of wins for each player
    
    2. Prevent users from typing other characters instead of numbers for the coordinates
    
    3. Better way to choose board spot (click instead of coordinates)
    
    4. Implement an AI for the player to play against
    
    5. Incorporate a better UI (web, app, desktop)
