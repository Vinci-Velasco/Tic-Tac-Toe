# Tic-Tac-Toe
C++ implementation of tic tac toe on the command line.

Goal: To recreate a simple game of tic-tac-toe for practice as 1st year
      computer science student.

Possible ways to expand the project:
    1. Display # of wins for each player
    2. Better way to choose board spot (click instead of coords)
    3. Implement an AI for the player to play against
    4. Incorporate a better UI (web, app, desktop)
